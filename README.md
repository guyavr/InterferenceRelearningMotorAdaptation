# InterferenceRelearningMotorAdaptation
## Codes and data accompanying the preprint: Avraham and Ivry. Interference underlies attenuation upon relearning in motor adaptation

### Codes:
DataAnalysis: This folder includes custom-written Matlab codes (.m) to analyze the data from Experiments 1-5. The name of each code file ends with "main". The folder also contains Matlab data files (.mat) that can be generated by the data analysis codes.

Functions: Contains all custom-written functions for statistical analyses and plotting (called by data analysis codes).

### Data:
Includes raw data collected during the experiments

  Experiment 1- AttenuationInterference_AntiClampWashRep_trials.mat
  Experiment 2- AttenuationInterference_NoFBWash_trials.mat
  Experiment 3- AttenuationInterference_GradRotWash_trials.mat
  Experiment 4- AttenuationInterference_AntiClamp_Verid85_trials.mat
  Experiment 5- AttenuationInterference_Verid_5_45_85_trials.mat

  Each data file contain a Table T with the following variables (variables can change across experiments):
    SN- subject number
    TN- trial number
    CCW- rotation direction during learning: 1- Counterclockwise; 0- Clockwise
    ti- target location (deg)
    ri- rotation size and direction: positive values- counterclockwise rotation; negative values- clockwise rotation.
    hand_theta- hand movement direction with respect to the target direction at the radial distance to the target (this variable was used as the 'hand angle' measure in the paper)
    raw_ep_hand_ang- actual hand movement direction at the radial distance to the target (without subtracting target location)
    MT- movement time (the interval between the time at which the amplitude of the movement exceeded 1 cm from the start location to the time at which the amplitude reached the radial distance of the target)
    RT- reaction time (the interval between the imperative onset and the time that the hand position exceeded a distance of 1 cm from the start location)
    ST- search time (the time required to move back to the start location)
    CN- cycle number

More details on how the data was processed and analyzed can be found in the Methods section of the paper.
